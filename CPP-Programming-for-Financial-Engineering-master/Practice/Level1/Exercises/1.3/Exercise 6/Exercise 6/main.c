       In a right arithmetic shift, the sign bit (the MSB in two's complement) is shifted in on the left. Thus, the sign of the operand is preserved (not necessarily consistent across platforms). 
       In contrast, a logical right-shift inserts value 0 bits into the most significant bit, instead of copying the sign bit.
       The logical right-shift is ideal for unsigned binary numbers, while the arithmetic right-shift is ideal for signed two's complement binary numbers. */

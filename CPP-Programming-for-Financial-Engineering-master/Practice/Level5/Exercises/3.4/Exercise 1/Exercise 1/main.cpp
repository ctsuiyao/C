       (1) 'startPoint' and 'endPoint' are created and initialised by the system, and
       the Point default constructor is called 1+1 times;
     
       (2) 'startPoint' and 'endPoint' are initialzed again in the Line default constructor by calling the Point default constructor, so the Point default constructor is called 1+1 times again.
     
       So, creating a line object, the Point default constructor is called 4 times, and 
       the Point deconstructor is called 4 times as well.
     
       Using colon sytax for the Line default constructor:
     
       'startPoint' and 'endPoint' are initialized upon creation, and 
       the Point default constructor is called 2 times, so is the Point destructor.

As mentioned above, editing the scheme worked for me but getting to the scheme was different.

Use the Product Menu
Select the Scheme option
Select the Edit Scheme option
Click the Options Tab
Tick the "Working Directory" item
Click the small icon at the right end of the text box.
Select the directory

I also had the Run/Debug option selected in the left hand pane of the window.

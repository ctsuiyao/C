       A third point besides p1 and p2 is "constructed" by copying p2 to
       the stack by Distance(Point p) without calling any constructor.
       But deconstructor ~Point() is called three times to free
       p1, p2, and the third point from the stack.
       Thus, constructors are called twice to create p1 and p2, and
       ~Point() is called three times to free all the three points.
    
       While with declaring copy constructor Point(const Point& P):
       Each of the three constructors is called once, and deconstructor 
       is called three times. 
       Thus, the number of constructor calls now is the same as
       the number of destructor calls. */

       You will get the copy constructor 'for free' when you do not create one yourself." */
